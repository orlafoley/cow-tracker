# cow-tracker
A small project to test out LAMP stack development by updating a small database that represents a cattle farm.

This project contains four webpages with corresponding code to connect to three tables within the database. The first of the webpages has an overview of the project, suggestions for anyone interested in agriculture and/or technology to expand upon this project, and a counter which updates as calves on the farm are born (added to the database).

The tables contain information on the cows, calves and parent/child relationships on a farm. The calf table can be altered by anyone using this project. The cow table cannot be altered by the interface created. The relationships between calves and cows are updated in the background rather than directly by the person using this interface.

This project contains two webpages for a farmer to view his/her herd as a neatly formatted table. This contains relevant information such as the breed of the animal in question.

There is a fourth webpage with a form to add each new calf to the system as it's born.
